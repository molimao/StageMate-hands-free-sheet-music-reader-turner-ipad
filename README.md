## 👋 Introduction

**Stop interrupting your performance to flip pages.**

[StageMate](https://stagemate.site/) is an innovative iOS application designed for instrumentalists, singers, and bands. It solves the biggest pain point in live performance: **turning sheet music pages without taking your hands off your instrument.**

Using advanced facial recognition technology, StageMate allows you to flip pages simply by **blinking** or **tilting your head**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Hands-Free Page Turning
* **Blink to Turn:** A deliberate blink flips the page instantly.
* **Head Gesture:** Tilt your head left or right to navigate scores.
* **Reverse Action:** Support for turning pages backward with gestures.

### 🎼 Unified Sheet Music Management
* **Universal Import:** Import scores via Photo, PDF, or Image files.
* **Centralized Library:** Organize all your tabs, chords, and lyrics in one place.
* **Smart Search:** Find any song in seconds, no matter how large your library is.

### 🎸 Built for the Stage (Gig-Ready)
* **Setlists:** Create and order setlists for different gigs via drag-and-drop.
* **Performance Mode:** Keeps the screen **always on** and optimizes layout for visibility.
* **Built-in Metronome:** Quick access to tempo control during practice or live shows.

### ☁️ Seamless Sync
* **iCloud Sync:** Your library automatically syncs between iPhone and iPad.
* **Multi-Device:** Practice on your phone, perform on your iPad.

## 📱 Why StageMate?

Whether you play **guitar**, **piano**, **violin**, or drums, manual page-turning breaks your flow. Bluetooth pedals are great, but they are extra hardware to carry (and charge).

**StageMate turns your device into a smart page-turner:**
1.  **No extra hardware** needed.
2.  **No batteries** to charge (besides your iPad).
3.  **100% Focus** on your music.
